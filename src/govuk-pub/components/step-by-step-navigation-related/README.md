# Step by step navigation related

Links to step by step navigations that a page is part of.

The component is designed to go on a content page to accompany a small step by step navigation in a sidebar. It provides links to one or more step by step navigation pages.

The component has two uses:

- above the step by step navigation sidebar, it provides a link to the main step by step navigation
- below the step by step navigation sidebar, it shows and links to any other step by step navigations that this page belongs to

In the first use case, only one link should be present and the entire text of the component should be contained in a heading. In the second use case, if more than one link is provided, the links should be shown in a list, separate from the heading.
