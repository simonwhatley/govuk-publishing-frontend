# Image card

Displays an image and associated text with a link.

An image and links, meant for use for news articles and people. Includes optional paragraph and additional links.

The component is generally to be used within a grid column but has no grid of its own, so the text and the images in the examples below may not always line up. This will normally look tidier, for example on [pages like this](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/attorney-generals-office).
